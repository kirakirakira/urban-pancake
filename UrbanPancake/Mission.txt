Your mission is to figure out who the thief is. Miss Krumpet called the authorities and they gathered up as much evidence as they could from the scene of the crime. They also interviewed other Urban Pancake patrons that were in the shop at the time of the incident. Miss Krumpet handed over her book of receipts in the hopes that this criminal could be an angry frequent customer that they'd be able to track down. Take a look through the evidence, and when you figure out who the criminal is, enter their name in the appropriate menu.
