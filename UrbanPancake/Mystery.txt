Urban Pancake is a quaint breakfast spot downtown in Waxville that the locals have all rated as 5 stars on Yelp. High schoolers come in after school for a cup of coffee and the leftover donut holes, and you wouldn't even know they were there because they never make a peep. So it was a surprise to everyone when someone dressed all in black with bright orange tennis shoes came in one morning and demanded to be given all of the donuts, or else. The owner, Miss Krumpet, shook in her boots, and handed over what had been made so far that day. Miss Krumpet reported that the thief was upset because they were out of chocolate cake donuts and those were their favorite. Miss Krumpet was unable to provide many details on the person's appearance because they had a black baseball cap over their eyes and a black mask over their face. But she did say it had looked like they had stepped in either mud or dog poop and there was a bit of toilet paper stuck to that. She had to mop the floor three times before she could get her floor clean. The thief also managed to knock into a glass case of trophies on their way out. A soccer trophy fell and broke on the ground. The thief seemed a bit upset about that and picked it back up off the floor and onto a nearby table before they left.
